                    P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah<br>
                    Milli point two just to hurt you, ah<br>
                    All red lamb just to tease you, ah<br>
                    None of these toys on lease too, ah<br>
                    Made your whole year in a week too, yeah<br>

                   <p> House so empty, need a centerpiece<br>
                    Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony<br>
                    Cut that ivory into skinny pieces<br>
                    Then she clean it with her face, man<br>
                    I love my baby<br>
